                <h1>HQ</h1>
                <p>Location of our main base of operations is a well kept secret. This is to avoid the jealous rage of our competitors. All of our R&D is conducted at the HQ. The HQ also houses a storage facility for prototypes and special weapons that only our own private military branch can use.</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <p>Do you have nuclear weapons?</p>
            <p>Many international organizations have conducted inspections around our facilities and have found no traces of nuclear weapons. So the answer is no.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Why do you invade countries (like Cuba in 2040)?</p>
            <p>If our client pays for it, we do it. Customer is king.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Why do you sell weapons to terrorists?</p>
            <p>WE choose who we sell our products and services to. And secondly: who decided that they are terrorists? The UN?</p>
